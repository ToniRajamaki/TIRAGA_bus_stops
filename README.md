## 🌐 Project Overview

This repository features different projects that helped me learn and practice fundamental algorithms and data structures. The projects include input and output testing to validate the correctness and performance of the algorithms. Each test file is designed to ensure proper functionality and measure the performance of various operations. The code is written in C++ and uses text-based commands for input and output.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Algorithm Implementations**: Includes various classic algorithms implemented from scratch.
- **Test File System**: A set of input and output test files to validate the correctness of the algorithms.
- **Performance Tests**: Specific tests to evaluate the efficiency of different operations.

## 📚 How to Run the Tests

- Files named `...-in.txt` are input files containing commands for different tests.
- Files named `...-out.txt` are output files containing the expected output for the corresponding input.
- To execute a test, use the command `read "...-in.txt"`.
- To compare your output with the expected output, use the command `testread "...-in.txt" "...-out.txt"` (the graphical UI allows selecting both files using control-click).
- Files named `perftest-....txt` are used for performance tests and can be run with the command `read "perftest-....txt"`.

## 🔍 Correctness Tests

- **simpletest-compulsory/all-in/out.txt**: Basic test to catch the most obvious bugs.
- **example-compulsory/all-in/out.txt**: Example from the assignment description, demonstrating the basic operation of all commands.
- **Tretest-compulsory/all-in/out.txt**: Additional tests using real Tampere center bus stop data.

## 📊 Performance Tests

- **Tre-Ksksta-....txt**: Bus stop data for Tampere center (~37 stops, ~7 regions).
- **Tre-A-....txt**: Data for Tampere pay zone A (~542 stops, ~12 regions).
- **Tre-ABC-....txt**: Data for Tampere pay zones A, B, and C (~2296 stops, ~33 regions).

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [x] **Basic Algorithm Implementation**: Develop classic algorithms for practice.
- [x] **Create Input/Output Testing System**: Design a system to validate the correctness of implementations.
- [ ] **Expand Performance Tests**: Add more performance tests to evaluate efficiency.
- [ ] **Implement Advanced Algorithms**: Expand the repository with more advanced data structures and algorithms.
